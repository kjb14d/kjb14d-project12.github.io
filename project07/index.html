        <h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        <p>After realizing I enjoy creating games more than playing them I quickly became obsessed with trying to find the right tools for the job.<br> While searching through multiple gaming engines I found the Unity gaming engine. The overall functionality of the software makes programming easier for implementing scrips to objects. The ability to create game logic for images imported into the Unity creates results instantly.</p> 
        <p>According to unity3d.com it's The world's favorite mobile engine, and I have to say I agree.<br> "Since Unity launched iPhone and iPod Touch deployment in 2008, the Unity game engine has attracted mobile developers in ever-increasing numbers." More importantly, nearly half of all mobile game developers today use Unity. Blizzard created Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, which has become one of its most popular titles. That success is due to how easy it is to use on both PCs and tablets, a big accomplishment for Blizzard since Hearthstone was its first-ever game for mobile devices. Much of the credit goes to Unity's tools, which make it easier to create games that work across devices, said Jason Chayes, who headed up production for Hearthstone.</p>

            <h1>Unity is awesome</h1>
            <q>As the only leading middleware designed from the ground up to support rapid iteration and on the fly editing, Unity cuts development times drastically in the rapidly moving mobile marketplace.</q>
        </div> <!-- end sidebar -->
        <p>The Unity engine is unique in enabling deployment to the full range of major current mobile ecosystems:<br> IOS, Android, Windows Phone 8 and BlackBerry 10. Programming as a Unity developer can be a rewarding career choice. There are many games being made for mobil phones and tablets creating many new jobs for programmers. Unity is a great tool for app development.</p>
        <p>The Unity gaming engine has many advantages to the indie game developer.<br> One major advantage of using the Unity gaming engine is having the option to publish games to multiple gaming platforms.<br> For example after creating a game there are easy to use button icons for publication on mobile phones, Xbox, Playstation, etc...</p>
